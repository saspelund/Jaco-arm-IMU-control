# Jaco-arm-IMU-control
Current status: Attempting to upload existing code to GitHub

This program enables the user to control a Kinova Jaco arm in 2 dimensions using 4 YEI IMUs placed on the front and back of each of the user's shoulder. The transformation matrix between the movements as recorded by the IMUs and the 2D output is created using a PCA program not presented here.

There is also plotting functionality to enable the user to see a goal projected onto a screen for trainsing purposes. There will be additional data recording functionality added at a later point.

If you notice this repository and have some helpful advice, it would be very welcome as all students involved are not programmers by trade.
